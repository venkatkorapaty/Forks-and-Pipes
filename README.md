# Forks-and-Pipes
A small-scaled search engine that uses forks and pipes to search through index files. It takes a string input, and looks through the files and returns all values where the string exists.
query.c has the main function to run, where you give the string input. and searches through index files, with the files that have the string values to be found, that are in the same folder.
